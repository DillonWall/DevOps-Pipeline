## Why this project?
  1. Technology Exposure:

My primary motivation was to immerse myself in the world of DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and containerization. By setting up a complete pipeline, I could gain hands-on experience with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins.
<br/><br/>

  2. Stay Up-to-Date:

The tech landscape changes rapidly, and staying ahead of the curve requires continuous learning. This project allowed me to explore the latest advancements, from CI/CD practices to monitoring and scaling strategies.
<br/><br/>

  3. Real-World Application:

Rather than theoretical exercises, I wanted a tangible project that mirrors real-world scenarios. A Spring Boot microservice provided the perfect canvas to apply DevOps principles in practice.
